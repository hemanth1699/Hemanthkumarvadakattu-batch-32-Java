I worked on the Client Transfer Application (CTA), an intranet program that facilitates ACH, Cheques, Wires, and
Journal transactions, among other types of money transfer activities. Our field officers, financial advisers, and bank
specialists can use different screens for each sort of money transfer transaction because our UI was created as a
single page application using Angular. For all types of transactions, we have microservices in the backend that are
hosted in the cloud. We utilized Relational DB instances from AWS, a follow-up server DB. Additionally, we have
a Redis cache that handles all of our read operations in front of all of our DBs. For each read and write operation,
 we have a separate instance of the database. Additionally, all microservices hosted on AWS.
